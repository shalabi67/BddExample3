@TimeSlot
Feature: Time slot
  This functionality allows the systems to identify time slots. time slots can be available or unavailable.
  Time-slot has a date with time, think of it as an event in calendar.
  Start with these assumptions:
  ○ each time-slot is 30 minutes long
  ○ there are 16 of them in the day
  ○ the first one starts at 9:00
  ○ stylists work 7 days a week (ouch!) so you don’t have to worry about
  weekends
  Good time-slot model would allow easy future adjustments like change of slot length and change of number of slots per day.
